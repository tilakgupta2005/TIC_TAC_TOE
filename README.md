## How to Play

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns placing their symbol ('X' or 'O') on an empty cell.
3. To place your symbol, enter the corresponding number (1-9) for the cell you want to occupy.
4. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
5. If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

## Rules

- Players take turns placing their symbols ('X' or 'O') on the grid.
- The game ends when one player achieves three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, or when all cells are filled without a winner.
- A player cannot place their symbol on a cell that is already occupied.

## How to Check Win/Lose

- After each move, the game checks for a win condition.
- If a player has achieved three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, the game declares that player as the winner.
- If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
